		<p>Since I was a little girl, I have dedicated myself to music, especially singing. I started at the age of 7 in the choir of my school and in presentations in private. Time later, I joined Mayre Martinez's musical producer, winner of the first "Latin American Idol", which later became the production company "Solo Tu Voz". I had presentations at several theaters in Caracas, such as the "Centro Cultural BOD" </p>
